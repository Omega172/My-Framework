# The Injector
The DLL injector supports 2 injection modes
- LoadLibrairy with optional support to bypass VAC
- ManualMap

This injector is made to be used with the OmegaWare Framework it does not support taking in a process name as an argument, it assumes you have the process name hardcoded in the FRAMEWORK_TARGET_PROCESS define in FrameworkConfig.h on line 12.
